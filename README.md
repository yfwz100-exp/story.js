Story.js - a story-based framework
======================

Story.js framework is a story-based framework targeting a game or a story-based programs which adopts a some independent scenes involved with actors. 

Structure
----------------------

Story.js framework adopts a very simple **function-based** principle. Each class of the game is *independent* from each other and they communicates with each other by the **prototype-based** strategy that everything shall be something that it looks like.

The framework is mainly divided into three parts: **story**, **scene** and **actors**. By design, they are all function-like classes which means that objects of these classes can be regarded as function.

*As the project is still developing, there're no document plan yet. But the source code is well documented so for each method of the class you can refer to the source directly.*

About the Project
----------------------

It is a framework that accidently came to my mind in the early January. Feeling somewhat confused about the future of life, I drafted a game and extract parts of the game as a new framework which was lately known as Story.js . After some thoughts about the framework, and the accidently came the research demo, I found it easy to draft a story-based demo of the research work during my internship. So that's how the name came.

The project is licensed with [BSD-like license](https://github.com/yfwz100/story.js/blob/master/LICENSE).
